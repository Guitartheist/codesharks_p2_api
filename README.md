# Trial by Combat

Trial By Combat is a(n) auto-battler/turn-based game built using Java Spring Boot.

Players can register an account and log in to create characters and buy equipment in the forms of weapons, armor, and potions. Characters are saved in between sessions using an Azure SQL database accessed via Hibernate.

Players can post their own challenges or accept one that has already been posted. Be careful though, as losing a challenge means permanent death and restarting right back from square one with a new character!The character creator and menus are built on the Javascript React framework and allow you to customize your loadouts or choose from one another player has shared to get into the fray even quicker.
